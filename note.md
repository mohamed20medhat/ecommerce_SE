- no modification to css so far
- save cove by json problem in the products/new -> save cover -> parse
- open the other project next to here as a refrence
- it looks like if it can't parse the text of the image name 

=> it's related to file pond and it's configuration => it's not working => i managed to get it to work. it was something related to the style sheets

=> next step -> the edit. and changing the colors 


# my todos 
- connect to new db and change the db_schema
- change the routes to accept the new schema 
- change the frontend -- the forms to take the new data and submit it to the database
- user -- home page can show products in cards
- admin -- product page shows add and delete and edit
